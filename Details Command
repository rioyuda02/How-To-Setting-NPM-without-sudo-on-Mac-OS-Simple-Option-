    # the result is like this ->  jshint : command not found
    # because we don't have this directory in our system's $PATH
    # We can solve this easily with edit file ".profile"
        Command= vi ~/.profile
        #However maybe your .profile file is a *Read-only* you can change to *Read-Write* with direct input command into vi ~/.profile
          Command=  :wq!
        #Re-open again .profile with command: vi ~/.profile
          
    # and then add a line
